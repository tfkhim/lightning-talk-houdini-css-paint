This project contains slides and examples for a lightning talk about
[Houdini CSS API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Houdini).

# Slides

The slides use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and are hosted at the
projects [GitHub page](https://tfkhim.github.io/lightning-talk-houdini-css-paint).

## Local Development

The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a development server.
To start it run the following command

    npm start

The slides can then be accessed at http://localhost:5173/lightning-talk-houdini-css-paint. The dev server
will pick up any changes to the `index.hml` and `index.js`.
